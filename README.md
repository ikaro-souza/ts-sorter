# ts-sorter
A generic collection sorter 

### In this project you have examples 2 of how to use the generic entities for sorting collections. 
- One is creating a Sorter class with a sort() method that excepts any enitity that implements the interface ISortable as an argument.
- The order is by making the classes that implement ISortable, implement its own sort() method.

#### It's important to note that the sorting algorithm used here is totally up to you to decide, I used bubble sorting just as an example.
